#1. King of Glory
[v1]
King of Glory, fill this place
We just wanna be with You
Just wanna be with You
King of Glory, fill this place
Just wanna be with You
Just wanna be with You


#2. I am Thine, O Lord, I have heard Thy voice 
[v1]
Draw me nearer, nearer, blessed Lord,
To the cross where Thou hast died;
Draw me nearer, nearer, blessed Lord,
To Thy precious, bleeding side.


#3. Draw Me Close
[v1]
Draw me close to You
Never let me go
I lay it all down again
To hear You say that I'm Your friend

[v2]
You are my desire
No one else will do
'Cause nothing else can take Your place
To feel the warmth of Your embrace
Help me find the way, bring me back to You

[v3]
You're all I want
You're all I've ever needed
You're all I want
Help me know You are near


#4. Just to Be Close to You
[v1]
Just to be close to you, 
Just to be close to you
Just to be close to you
Is my desire

[v2]
Just to be close to you,
Just to be close to you
Just to be close to you
Is my desire


#5. More Than Anything
[v1]
I love You, Jesus
I worship and adore You
Just want to tell You 
Lord, I love You more than anything

[v2]
I love You, Jesus
I worship and adore You
Just want to tell You
Lord, that I love You more than anything

#6. I Give Myself Away
[v1]
My life is not my own
To you I belong
I give myself, I give myself to you

[v2]
My life is not my own
To you I belong
I give myself, I give myself to you

[v3]
I give myself away (I give myself away)
I give myself away
So You can use me
I give myself away
I give myself away
So You can use me
