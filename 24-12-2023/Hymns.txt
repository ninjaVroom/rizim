#2. Trust & Obey  
[v1]
When we walk with the Lord in the light of His Word
What a glory He sheds on our way! 
While we do His good will, He abides with us still
And with all who will trust and obey 
 
[v2]
Trust and obey, for there's no other way 
To be happy in Jesus, but to trust and obey 
 
[v3]
Not a shadow can rise, not a cloud in the skies
But His smile quickly drives it away 
Not a doubt or a fear, not a sigh or a tear 
Can abide while we trust and obey 
 
[v4]
Trust and obey, for there's no other way 
To be happy in Jesus, but to trust and obey

Oh, for grace to trust Him more

#Bonus. Higher Ground  
[v1]
I'm pressing on the upward way,
New heights I'm gaining ev'ry day;
Still praying as I'm onward bound, 
"Lord, plant my feet on higher ground."
 
[v2]
Lord, lift me up, and let me stand
By faith, on heaven's tableland; 
A higher plane than I have found,
Lord, plant my feet on higher ground.
