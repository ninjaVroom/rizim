#1. The Heart Of Worship 
[v1]
I'm coming back to the heart of worship 
For it's all about You 
It's all about You, Jesus 
I'm sorry, Lord, for the thing I've made it 
When it's all about You 
It's all about You, Jesus

[v2]
King of endless worth 
No one could express 
How much You deserve 
Though I'm weak and poor 
All I have is Yours 
Every single breath 

[v3]
I'll bring You more than a song 
For a song in itself 
Is not what You have required 
You search much deeper within
Through the way things appear 
You're looking into my heart 

[v4]
I'm coming back to the heart of worship
And it's all about You, 
It's all about You, Jesus 
I'm sorry, Lord, for the thing I've made it
When it's all about You 
It's all about You, Jesus

[v5]
Oh, it's all about You 
Oh, it's all about You
It's all about You, it's all about You 
It's all about You, it's all about You 
It's all about You, it's all about You 
It's all about You, it's all about You 


#2. Take The Stage Lord 
[v1]
Take the stage lord 
And have your way 
I'm just a vessel 
And nothing more 
And when you're done 
Please take the glory 
I'm satisfied just to see you glorified


#3. Be Glorified
[v1]
Be glorified, be glorified 
Be glorified, be glorified 

[v2]
Be glorified in the Heavens 
Be glorified in the earth 
Be glorified in this temple 

[v3]
Jesus, Jesus, be thou glorified 
Jesus, Jesus, be thou glorified 


#4. I Stand In Awe
[v1]
And I stand, I stand in awe of You 
I stand, I stand in awe of You 
Holy God, to whom all praise is due 
I stand in awe of You 

[v2]
You are beautiful beyond description 
Too marvelous for words 
Too wonderful for comprehension 
Like nothing ever seen or heard 
Who can grasp Your infinite wisdom? 
Who can fathom the depth of Your love? 
You are beautiful beyond description 
Majesty, enthroned above  

[v3]
I stand, I stand in awe of You 
I stand, I stand in awe of You 
Holy God, to whom all praise is due 
I stand in awe of You, 0 God 

[v4]
I stand, I stand in awe of You 
I stand, I stand in awe of You (holy God) 
Holy God, to whom all praise is due 
I stand in awe of You 


#5. Open The Floodgates Of Heaven 
[v1]
Let it rain 
Let it rain 
Open the floodgates of heaven


[v2]
Open the floodgates of heaven
Let it rain 
Let it rain
