1. Tis so sweet to trust in Jesus	
[v1]
Tis so sweet to trust in Jesus
Just to take Him at His Word
Just to rest upon His promise
Just to know, "Thus saith the Lord"
[v2]

Jesus, Jesus, how I trust Him
How I've proved Him o'er and o'er
Jesus, Jesus, precious Jesus
Oh, for grace to trust Him more
[v3]

I'm so glad I learned to trust Him
Precious Jesus, Savior, Friend
And I know that He is with me
Will be with me to the end
[v4]

Jesus, Jesus, how I trust Him
How I've proved Him o'er and o'er
Jesus, Jesus, precious Jesus
Oh, for grace to trust Him more

2. There’s not a Friend like the lowly Jesus
[v1]
There's not a friend like the lowly Jesus–
No, not one! no, not one!
None else could heal all our soul's diseases–
No, not one! no, not one!

[Refrain]
Jesus knows all about our struggles,
He will guide till the day is done;
There's not a friend like the lowly Jesus–
No, not one! no, not one!

[v2]
No friend like Him is so high and holy–
No, not one! no, not one!
And yet no friend is so meek and lowly–
No, not one! no, not one!

[Refrain]
Jesus knows all about our struggles,
He will guide till the day is done;
There's not a friend like the lowly Jesus–
No, not one! no, not one!

[v3]
There's not an hour that He is not near us –
No, not one! no, not one!
No night so dark but His love can cheer us–
No, not one! no, not one!

[Refrain]
Jesus knows all about our struggles,
He will guide till the day is done;
There's not a friend like the lowly Jesus–
No, not one! no, not one!

[v4]
Was e'er a gift like the Savior given?
No, not one! no, not one!
Will He refuse us a home in heaven?
No, not one! no, not one!

[Refrain]
Jesus knows all about our struggles,
He will guide till the day is done;
There's not a friend like the lowly Jesus–
No, not one! no, not one!

3. Come Walk With Me By [Marvia Providence]
[v1]	
Come walk with me,
The road is straight and narrow, 
Come walk with me, 
I can not walk alone, 
For the road is rough, 
And there are many danger, 
Come walk with me,
And I will see you through.
