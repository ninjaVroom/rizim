#1: OUR GOD 
[v1]
Water You turned into wine 
Opened the eyes of the blind 
There's no one like you 
None like you 
Into the darkness You shine 
Out of the ashes we rise 
There's No one like you 
None like you 

[v2]
Our God is greater, our God is stronger 
God You are higher than any other 
Our God is Healer, awesome in power 
Our God, Our God 

[v3]
Into the darkness you shining 
Out of the ashes we Rise 
No one like you 
None like you 

[C]
Our God is greater, our God is stronger 
God You are higher than any other 
Our God is Healer, awesome in power 
Our God, Our God 
Our God is greater, our God is stronger 
God You are higher than any other 
Our God is Healer, awesome in power 
Our God, Our God 

[v5]
And if Our God is for us, then who could ever stop us? 
And if our God is with us, then what can stand against? 
And if God is with us, then what can stand against? 
Then what can stand against?

#4: Days of Elijah 
[v1]
These are the days of Elijah 
Declaring the word of the Lord 
And these are the days of Your servant Moses 
Righteousness being restored 
[v2]
And though these are days of great trial 
Of famine and darkness and sword 
Still, we are the voice in the desert crying 
"Prepare ye the way of the Lord!" 
[v3]
Behold, He comes riding on the clouds 
Shining like the sun at the trumpet call 
Lift your voice, the year of jubilee 
And out of Zion's hill, salvation comes 
[v4]
And these are the days of Ezekiel
The dry bones becoming as flesh 
And these are the days of Your servant David 
Rebuilding a temple of praise 
[v5]
Oh, these are the days of the harvest 
For the fields are as white in Your world 
And we are the labourers in Your vineyard 
Declaring the word of the Lord! 
[v6]
Behold, He comes, riding on the clouds 
Shining like the sun at the trumpet call 
Lift your voice, the year of jubilee 
And out of Zion's hill, salvation comes 
[c]
There's no God like Jehovah x6 
There's no God like Jehovah ehhhh 
[v7]
Behold, He comes, riding on the clouds 
Shining like the sun at the trumpet call 
Lift your voice, the year of jubilee 
And out of Zion's hill, salvation comes
